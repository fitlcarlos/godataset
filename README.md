GoData is a library that facilitates interaction with a database and manipulation of data through a dataset.

A dataset consists of a series of records, each containing any number of fields and a pointer to the current record. The dataset may have a direct, one-to-one correspondence with a physical table, or, as a result of a query, it may be a subset of a table or a join of several tables.
